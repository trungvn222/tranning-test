Congrats and GuessedWord Components
    Testing with props
        Hand down state from parent
    Don't need to be connected to redux
        Never updates state
    Set up some common tools

Simple redux 
    Work with success piece of state
    Action creator creates CORRECT_GUESS action
    Reducer updates success
    Input component conditionally renders

Redux thunk
    Action creators that fire off multiple actions
    guessWord
        Add to guessedWords
        Conditionally update success

Async Action Creators and Axios
    Test action creator that gets secretWord from server

Redux props in Connected Components
    Test state props and action creator props in
        Input
